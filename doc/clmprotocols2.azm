\sec{internal}{Network representation}


\par{
   The clustering program \mcl expects the name of file as its first argument.

   If the \genopt{--abc} option is used, the file is assumed to adhere to a
   simple format where a network is specified edge by edge, one line and one
   edge at a time.

   Each line describes an edge as two labels and a numerical value, all
   separated by white space. The labels and the value respectively identify the
   two nodes and the edge weight. The format is called \abc-format,
   where '\sc{A}' and '\sc{B}' represent the two labels and '\sc{C}' represents the
   edge weight. The latter is optional; if omitted the edge weight is set to one.
   If \abc-format is used, the output is returned as a listing of clusters,
   each cluster given as a line of white-space separated labels.

   }


\par{
   MCL can also utilize a second representation, which is a stringent and
   unambiguous format for both input and output.

   This is called \it{matrix format} and it is required when using other
   programs in the mcl suite, for example when comparing and analysing
   clusterings using \mysib{clm} or when extracting and transforming
   networks using \mysib{mcx}.

   Native mode (matrix format) is entered simply by \it{not} specifying
   \genopt{--abc}.
   }

   
\par{
   The recommended approach using \mcl is to convert an external format to
   \abc-format. The program \mysib{mcxload} reads the latter and creates a
   native network file and a dictionary file that maps network nodes to
   labels.  All applications in the MCL suite, including \mcl itself, can read
   this native network file format. Label output can be obtained using
   \mysib{mcxdump}.  The workflow is thus:

   }

\verbatim{\:/
   #  External format has been converted to file data.abc (abc format)

   mcxload -abc data.abc --stream-mirror -write-tab data.tab -o data.mci  

   mcl data.mci -I 1.4
   mcl data.mci -I 2
   mcl data.mci -I 4

   mcxdump -icl out.data.mci.I14 -tabr data.tab -o dump.data.mci.I14
   mcxdump -icl out.data.mci.I20 -tabr data.tab -o dump.data.mci.I20
   mcxdump -icl out.data.mci.I40 -tabr data.tab -o dump.data.mci.I40}


\car{
   In this example the cluster output is stored in native format and dumped to
   labels using mcxdump.  The stored output can now be used to learn more about
   the clusterings.  An example is the following, where \mysib{clm} is applied
   in mode\~\bf{dist} to gauge the distance between different clusterings.

   }

\verbatim{\:/
   clm dist --chain out.data.mci.I{14,20,40}}

\sec{large}{Loading large networks}

\par{
   If you deal with very large networks (say with hundreds of millions
   of edges), it is recommended to use binary format (cf \mysib{mcxio}).
   This is simply achieved by adding \tt{--write-binary} to the mcxload
   command line. The resulting file is no longer human-readable but
   will be faster to read by a factor between ten- or twenty-fold
   compared to standard \MCL-edge network format, and a factor around fifty-fold
   compared to label format.
   All \MCL-edge programs are able to read binary format, and speed
   of reading will be somewhere in the order of millions of edges
   per second, compared to, for example, roughly 100K edges
   per second for label format.
   }

\par{
   Memory usage for mcxload can be lowered
   by replacing the option \tt{--stream-mirror} with \tt{-ri\~max}.
   }

\sec{formatconversion}{Converting between formats}

\par{
   \bf{Converting label format to tabular format}\|
   Label format, two or three (including weight) columns:
   }
\verbatim{\:/
   mcxload -abc data.abc --stream-mirror -write-tab data.tab -o data.mci
   mcxdump -imx data.mci -tab data.tab --dump-table}

\car{Simple Interaction File (SIF) format:}

\verbatim{\:/
   mcxload -sif data.sif --stream-mirror -write-tab data.tab -o data.mci
   mcxdump -imx data.mci -tab data.tab --dump-table}

\car{
   It can be noted that these two examples are very similar, and differ
   only in the way the input to \mcxload is specified.
   }

\sec{blast}{Clustering similarity graphs encoded in BLAST results}

\par{
   A specific instance of the workflow above is the clustering of proteins based on
   their sequence similarities. In the most typical scenario the external
   format is BLAST output, which needs to be transformed to \abc format.
   In the examples below the input is in columnar blast format
   obtained with the blast -m8 option.
   It requires a version of \mcl at least as recent as \v{09-061}.
   First we create an \abc-formatted file using the external columnar BLAST
   format, which is assumed to be in a file called \v{seq.cblast}.
   }

\verbatim{\:/
   cut -f 1,2,11 seq.cblast > seq.abc}

\car{
   The columnar format in the file \v{seq.cblast} has, for a given BLAST hit,
   the sequence labels in the first two columns and the asssociated E-value in
   column\~11.  It is parsed by the standard UNIX cut(1) utility. The format
   must have been created with the BLAST -m8 option so that no comment lines
   are present. Alternatively these can be filtered out using grep.
   }

\car{
   The newly created \v{seq.abc} file is loaded by \mysib{mcxload},
   which writes both a network file \v{seq.mci} and a dictionary
   file \v{seq.tab}.
   }

\verbatim{\:/
   mcxload -abc seq.abc --stream-mirror --stream-neg-log10 -stream-tf 'ceil(200)'
         -o seq.mci -write-tab seq.tab}

\car{
   The \v{--stream-mirror} option ensures that the resulting network will be
   undirected, as recommended when using \mcl. Omitting this option would
   result in a directed network as BLAST E-values generally differ between two
   sequences. The default course of action for \mysib{mcxload} is to use the
   best value found between a pair of labels.  The next option,
   \v{--abc-neg-log10} tranforms the numerical values in the input (the BLAST
   E-values) by taking the logarithm in base\~10 and subsequently negating the
   sign. Finally, the transformed values are capped so that any E-value below
   1e-200 is set to a maximum allowed edge weight of\~200.

   }

\par{
   To obtain clusterings from \v{seq.mci} and \v{seq.tab} one has two
   choices. The first is to generate an abstract clustering representation
   and from that obtain the label output, as follows.
   Below the \genopt{-o} option is not used, so mcl will create meaningful and
   unique output names by itself.  The default way of doing this is to preprend
   the prefix \v{out.} and to append a suffix encoding the inflation value
   used, with inflation encoded using two digits of precision and the decimal
   separator removed.

   }

\verbatim{\:/
   mcl seq.mci -I 1.4
   mcl seq.mci -I 2
   mcl seq.mci -I 4
   mcl seq.mci -I 6

   mcxdump -icl out.seq.mci.I14 -tabr seq.tab -o dump.seq.mci.I14
   mcxdump -icl out.seq.mci.I20 -tabr seq.tab -o dump.seq.mci.I20
   mcxdump -icl out.seq.mci.I40 -tabr seq.tab -o dump.seq.mci.I40
   mcxdump -icl out.seq.mci.I60 -tabr seq.tab -o dump.seq.mci.I60}

\car{
   Now the file \v{out.seq.tab.I14} and its associates can be used for example
   to compute the distances between the encoded clusterings with
   \clmdist, to compute a set of strictly reconciled nested clusterings
   with \clmorder, or to compute an efficiency criterion with
   \clminfo.

   }

\par{
   Alternatively, label output can be obtained directly from \mcl
   as follows.}

\verbatim{\:/
   mcl seq.mci -I 1.4  -use-tab seq.tab
   mcl seq.mci -I 2  -use-tab seq.tab
   mcl seq.mci -I 4  -use-tab seq.tab
   mcl seq.mci -I 6  -use-tab seq.tab}


\sec{array}{Clustering expression data}

\par{
   The clustering of expression data constitutes another workflow. In this case the
   external format usually is a tabular file format containing labels for genes
   or probes and numerical values measuring the expression values or fold
   changes across a series of conditions or experiments. Such tabular files can
   be processed by \mysib{mcxarray}, which comes installed with \mcl.  The
   program computes correlations (either Pearson or Spearmann) between genes,
   and creates an edge between genes if their correlation exceeds the specified
   cutoff.  From this \mysib{mcxarray} creates both a network file and a
   dictionary file. In the example below, the file \v{expr.data} is
   in tabular format with one row of column headers (e.g. tags for
   experiments) and one column of row identifiers (e.g. probe or gene identifiers).

   }

\verbatim{\:/
   mcxarray -data expr.data -skipr 1 -skipc 1 -o expr.mci -write-tab expr.tab --pearson -co 0.7 -tf 'abs(),add(-0.7)'
   }

\car{
   This uses the Pearson correlation, ignoring values below 0.7.
   The remaining values in the interval \v{[0.7-1]} are remapped to the interval
   \v{[0-0.3]}. This is recommended so that the edge weights will have
   increased contrast between them, as \mcl is affected by relative differences
   (ratios) between edge weights rather than absolute differences. To illustrate
   this, values\~0.75 and\~0.95 are mapped to\~0.05 and\~0.25, with respective
   ratios\~0.79 and\~0.25.
   The network file \v{expr.mci} and the dictionary file \v{expr.tab} can
   now be used as before.
   }

\par{
   It is possible to investigate the effect of the correlation cutoff as follows.
   First a network is generated at a very low threshold, and this network
   is analysed using \mcxquery.
   }


\verbatim{\:/
   mcxarray -data expr.data -skipr 1 -skipc 1 -o expr20.mcx --write-binary --pearson -co 0.2 -tf 'abs()'
   mcx query -imx expr20.mcx --vary-correlation
   }

\car{
   The output is in a tabular format describing the properties of the network
   at increasing correlation thresholds. Examples are the size of the biggest
   component, the number of orphan nodes (not connected to any other node), and
   the mean and median node degrees.
   A good way to choose the cutoff is to balance the number of singletons
   and the median node degree. Both should preferably not be too high.
   For example the number of orphan nodes should be
   less than ten percent of the total number of nodes,
   and the median node degree should be at most one hundred neighbours.

   }


\""{
   Label mode is very convenient for easy and fast exploration.  A decided
   advantage of full native mode (where both graph input and cluster output are
   in matrix format) is that the data can easily be analyzed and subjected to
   further processing.  Second, input that is stored in native binary format
   loads much faster than label data when the input data size grows large.  If
   neither of these is of concern then label mode may be entirely sufficient.
   For more information on label mode and native mode refer to examples in this
   manual and \mysib{mcxio}.}


\sec{degree}{Reducing node degrees in the graph}
\car{
   A good way to lower node degrees in a network is to require that
   an edge is among the best \it{k} edges (those of highest weight) for
   \it{both} nodes incident to the edge, for some value of \it{k}.  This is
   achieved by using \v{knn(k)} in the argument to the \genopt{-tf} option to
   mcl or \mcx{alter}.

   To give an example, a graph was formed on translations in Ensembl release 57 on 2.6M nodes.
   The similarities were obtained from BLAST scores,
   leading to a graph with a total edge count of 300M, with
   best-connected nodes of degree respectively
   11148, 9083, 9070, 9019 and 8988, and with mean node degree 233.
   These degrees are unreasonable.

   The graph was subjected to \mcx{query} to investigate the effect of
   varying k-NN parameters. A good heuristic is to choose a value
   that does not significantly change the number of singletons in the input graph.
   In the example it meant that \useopt{-tf}{'knn(160)'} was feasible, leading
   to a mean node degree of 98.
   }

\par{
   A second approach to reduce node degrees is to employ the \genopt{-ceil-nb} option.
   This ranks nodes by node degree, highest first. Nodes are considered
   in order of rank, and edges of low weight are removed from the graph until
   a node satisfies the node degree threshold specified by \genopt{-ceil-nb}.

   Using \mcl is as simple as
   typing (assuming a file \it{proteins} contains a matrix/graph
   in native matrix format)}

\verbatim{mcl proteins -I 2.0}

\car{
   The above will result in a clustering written to the file
   named \it{out.proteins.I20s2}. It is - of course -
   possible to explicitly specify the name of the output file
   using the \genoptref{-o}{fname} option. Refer to the

   each line containing a cluster in the form of tab-separated labels.

   Refer to \mysib{mcxio} for more information on tab files,
